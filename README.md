### Purpose Statement:

My app idea is to make sort of a modern "Grandma's Brag Book".  There is a large 'mature' audience out there who own a smart phone, thanks to their son or daughter, but get lost just trying to navigate within it, let alone making use of Social Networking sites to keep up with what their families are doing. 

This would really be a two part app, with an 'uploader' side, and a 'user' side.  The uploader would make a profile and post photos and a status, similar to Facebook, and grant permission for the user to view the profile.  The user would be able to view and show off pictures of the new grand-baby, or see recent achievements or funny moments of their grandkids without having to get web-savvy.

### Users:

  * Grandparents, or people with loved ones they want to keep up with
  * A patient  uploader, who wants to share info with non web-savvy loved ones

### Key Functionality:

On the uploader side, the uploader would create their profile and be able to add pictures and update their kid's status from either their own phone or their computer.  Then the uploader would install the app on the user's phone (Grandma's phone, as I imagine it).  There would need to be some sort of permissions granted for security's sake.  The user could then simply hit the icon on their phone, and see and show off their grandkids.  All UI elements would be designed to be very simple and obvious to use, with clear labeling and large fonts.
